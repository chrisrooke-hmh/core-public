                    For most of Roman history, the Senate had 300 members, although it could be larger. 
                    To qualify for membership, a citizen had to own property valued at 1 million sesterces—a huge fortune. 
                    Most senators were former magistrates, or elected officials, whose terms had ended. Only men could be senators.

                    Senate meetings were led by consuls, the highest elected officials in the Roman Republic. 
                    Two consuls were chosen each year in public elections. Besides leading Senate meetings, they commanded armies and governed provinces. 
                    Before emperors took over, the consuls were the most powerful men in Rome.

                    Take a look at what these senators are wearing. 
                    That garment is called a toga. Wearing a toga was a symbol of Roman citizenship; women and foreigners were not allowed to wear them. 
                    Most togas were white, but consuls and former consuls had a purple stripe on their togas as a symbol of honor.

                    Senate meetings were not always quiet affairs. 
                    Members often cheered, booed, or even heckled speakers. 
                    Some senators would leave their chairs during speeches and move to sit with colleagues who shared their opinions. 
                    Pointed remarks—and personal attacks—were common during debates.

                    Julius Caesar started work on the Curia Julia in Rome’s Forum after the old meeting place burned. 
                    However, in 44 BCE, Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators, and work halted. 
                    Emperor Augustus finished the curia some 15 years later. In the meantime, the Senate met in a nearby theater.

                    The ruins of the Curia Julia can still be seen in Rome today. 
                    Although much of the building has been damaged by time, its elaborate floor of red and green stone inlays on white marble tiles is still visible.

                    In general, only senators were allowed in Senate meetings. 
                    An exception was made for the lictors, a group of bodyguards assigned to each consul. 
                    Each lictor carried a fasces, a bundle of wooden rods with an axe, as a symbol of the consul’s power.

                    Welcome to the Curia Julia, the meeting place of the Roman Senate. 
                    During the Roman Republic from 509 to 27 BCE, the Senate was the main lawmaking body and the heart of the government. 
                    As power shifted to the emperors, the Senate remained important. 
                    It governed Rome and certain provinces and sometimes controlled finances and acted as a court. 
                    The meeting you see here is taking place early in the Empire, as the Senate attempts to define its role in the new government.
