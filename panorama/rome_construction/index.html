                <h3>Using Gravity</h3>
                <p>
                    Roman aqueducts did not use pumps to move water. 
                    Instead, the water was moved entirely by gravity. </br>
                    Each water channel was designed to slope slightly along its entire length. 
                    The incline was steep enough to keep water flowing but slight enough to be nearly undetectable to the eye. </p>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id = "entry2">
                <h3>Arches</h3>
                <p>
                    The Romans were the first civilization to use the arch in much of their construction. 
                    Arches are incredibly strong and can support huge loads. 
                    Without the arch, structures like this aqueduct would not have been possible. 
                    A weaker structure could collapse from its own weight.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id = "entry3">
                <h3>Cranes</h3>
                <p>
                    Stone is heavy, and the stones used to build this type of aqueduct were huge. 
                    To lift these enormous stones, the Romans used cranes like this one. 
                    With just a few people working a winch, this crane could lift stones weighing more than 3 tons.
                </p>

            <div id = "entry4">
                <h3>Roman Engineers</h3>
                <p>
                    Roman engineers probably did not receive much formal training. 
                    Each learned how to build aqueducts and bridges as an apprentice under an experienced builder. 
                    Unlike some ancient builders, Roman engineers did not study abstract concepts like trigonometry. 
                    They were more focused on practical results.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id = "entry5">
                <h3>The Workforce</h3>
                <p>
                    It took a huge workforce to build and maintain an aqueduct! 
                    At one point, Rome employed a force of 700 workers just to maintain the cityâ€™s aqueducts. 
                    Building crews like this one included a mix of experienced construction laborers and soldiers from nearby camps.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id = "entry6">
                <h3>Using Concrete</h3>
                <p>
                    What kind of material could support a structure like this? 
                    Concrete. The Romans invented an incredibly strong form of concrete, and they learned how to make it usable underwater. 
                    For this aqueduct, the workers have covered the concrete with brick to make it stronger.
                </p> 
            </div>
            <div id = "entry7">
                <h3>A Long Haul</h3>
                <p>
                    An aqueduct as large as this one took a great deal of stone, often more than was naturally available in the immediate area. 
                    Workers could haul in additional stone from nearby quarries, either traveling by boat or using a cart.
