                    At the heart of any Roman city was the Forum, or public square. 
                    The Forum was used for public events that ranged from political debates to entertainment. 
                    Every Forum had at least one temple and buildings for trade and business. Many had monuments, like statues or arches, to honor great leaders. </p>

                   To house a large population in a limited space, the Romans built large apartment buildings called insulae in which dozens of families could live. 
                    Some were as tall as 6 or 7 stories. By the 300s CE, the city of Rome had more than 40,000 insulae, in which all but the richest Romans lived.

                    The streets and forums of Roman cities were lined with market stalls, where shoppers could get raw or prepared food as well as shoes, clothes, and other goods. 
                    Specialty shops sold goods like books, metal goods, and spices. 
                    Many Romans bought their lunches at stalls to avoid cooking at home.

                    Have you heard the expression “All roads lead to Rome”? That certainly seemed to be true in the Roman Empire. 
                    People from all over the Roman world moved to Rome and other cities. 
                    On the street, one might hear people speaking dozens of languages, from Latin and Greek to Aramaic and Celtic languages.

                    The streets of Roman cities were crowded with both people and vehicles, including carts and chariots. 
                    Traffic was so heavy on some streets that vehicles’ wheels dug ruts into the cobblestones—ruts that can still be seen in the ruins of some ancient cities.

                    Graffiti was a popular form of expression in Roman cities. 
                    City dwellers scribbled messages about love, business, politics, and even literary references on the walls of buildings. 
                    In many cases their messages drew responses from passersby, leading to entire conversations recorded on city walls.

                    Crowded cities required a great deal of water. 
                    People needed water to drink, cook, bathe, and clean. 
                    Carried to the city by aqueducts, that water was fed into fountains and cisterns. 
                    People collected the water they needed from these public sources.

                    The ancient Romans kept a variety of animals as pets, including birds, cats, apes, and weasels. 
                    But dogs were the most popular by far. Dogs were seen as faithful companions as well as hunting partners and guardians. 
                    Besides scaring off thieves, dogs were considered protection against ghosts.

                    Welcome to an ancient Roman city! Although most Roman citizens were farmers who lived in rural areas, the heart of the Roman Empire was its cities. 
                    The city of Rome itself was by far the largest and most important in the empire. 
                    At its height, Rome may have been home to more than 1 million people. 
                    Other cities around the Roman world were home to tens or hundreds of thousands of people as well. 
                    Some of these people lived lives of wealth and luxury, but many were poor and lived in cramped and unsanitary conditions.
