                <h3>The Setting</h3>
                <p>
                    The Battle of Zama was fought in 202 BC in what is now Tunisia. The Roman army, hoping to end the Second Punic War, had invaded Africa and was advancing toward Carthage. 
                    This forced Hannibal and the Carthaginians, who had been raiding Italy, to rush to defend their homeland.

                <h3>Rome’s Mighty Army</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons Rome was able to expand its territory was the strength of its army. 
                    Roman soldiers were known throughout the Mediterranean for their training and discipline. 
                    The army at Zama included about 35,000 infantry soldiers, many of them seasoned veterans.

                <h3>Organization of the Army</h3>
                <p>
                    In the 200s BC, the Roman army was organized into units called maniples. 
                    Each maniple included about 120 soldiers, who were commanded by 2 officers called centurions. 
                    This organization allowed each maniple to operate independently of the rest, which gave the army flexibility.
                </p>

            <div id = "entry4">
                <h3>Weapons and Armor</h3>
                <p>
                    During this period, the Roman soldiers’ main weapon was a pilum, or spear. Each soldier carried two spears: a lightweight one to throw and a heavier one for hand-to-hand fighting. 
                    Most soldiers also carried a short sword, or gladius—which later became the main Roman weapon—and a heavy shield. 
                </p>

            <div id = "entry5">
                <h3>Cavalry</h3>
                <p>
                    The Romans understood the value of cavalry, or troops mounted on horseback, in war. 
                    But Scipio had few Roman cavalry soldiers at Zama. He hired skilled riders from Numidia in North Africa to fight on his side. 
                    Interestingly, the Carthaginians also hired Numidian cavalry soldiers for the battle.

                <h3>Hannibal’s Elephants</h3>
                <p>
                    One of Hannibal’s advantages in the Punic Wars was his use of war elephants, which had defeated some Roman armies in Italy. 
                    At Zama, however, the Romans broke ranks to surround the beasts. 
                    Some soldiers blew trumpets to scare the elephants. 
                    Panicked elephants even trampled some Carthaginian lines.

            <div id = "entry7">
                <h3>The Legion Standard</h3>
                <p>
                    Every legion in Rome’s army carried a unique standard into battle. 
                    (At this time, a legion included about 4,200 infantry soldiers.) 
                    The standard was a symbol of the legion and was protected as a matter of pride. 
                    It was also waved or raised to signal the army about which actions to take.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Carthage Is Defeated</h3>
                <p>
                    The discipline of the Roman army and the defeat of Hannibal’s elephants resulted in a sound defeat of the Carthaginian army. 
                    More than 20,000 Carthaginian soldiers died and about 20,000 were taken prisoner. 
                    Soon afterward, Carthage surrendered, and the Second Punic War ended.
