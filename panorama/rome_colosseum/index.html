                    The life of a gladiator was hard and, often, short. 
                    Who would choose that life? Some gladiators were slaves who were forced to fight. 
                    Others were former soldiers lured by the promise of money and fame. 
                    Successful gladiators were as popular—and rich—as rock stars and professional athletes are today.

                    Gladiators used a variety of weapons and armor. 
                    The majority fought with swords and shields, but some wore much heavier armor than others. 
                    Some used more unusual weapons, like this man, armed with a trident and a net. 
                    The Romans liked to see gladiators with different weapons fighting each other.

                    Gladiator games drew support from all classes of Roman society. 
                    Seating in the Colosseum was strictly organized by social class. 
                    The first few rows of seats were reserved for senators and their families. 
                    The next level up was for noble families, and so on. Poor citizens sat in the highest seats.

                    Most gladiators did not fight to the death. 
                    A gladiator was expensive to train, so most trainers wanted to keep the gladiators alive. 
                    However, fatal accidents were not uncommon. 
                    In addition, crowds and emperors sometimes called for defeated gladiators to be killed.

                    The Colosseum had a special box reserved for the imperial family and their attendants. 
                    During the Empire, most games were sponsored by emperors. 
                    At least one emperor, Commodus, was such a fan of gladiatorial fights that he took part himself—with the odds stacked in his favor, of course.

                    One of the engineering marvels of the Colosseum was the huge retractable awning that provided shade for the audience. 
                    Raising the awning required the efforts of hundreds of sailors, and scholars today are still not sure exactly how they managed to secure the heavy canvas.

                    Beneath the floor of the Colosseum was a maze of corridors, rooms, and cages. 
                    Gladiators waited in this area before matches, and wild animals were kept there in preparation for staged hunts. 
                    During these hunts, trained performers would stalk such exotic animals as lions, ostriches, and elephants.

                    This is the Colosseum, the home of Rome’s greatest gladiatorial games! Staged combats between gladiators—professional warriors 
                    who fought for the public’s entertainment—were one of the most popular spectacles in ancient Rome. 
                    The earliest fights between gladiators were held as part of funeral celebrations, 
                    but by the time of the late Republic they had grown into huge events attended by thousands of fans. 
                    Although Rome had many venues in which to hold these games, the Colosseum was the largest and best known. 
                    Built in the 70s CE by the emperor Vespasian, the Colosseum could hold 50,000 people.
