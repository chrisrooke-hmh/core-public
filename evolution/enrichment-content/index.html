    <h2>Sacagawea</h2>
    <p aria-role="doc-subtitle">(c. 1787 – 1812)</p>
    <p>Sacagawea, whose name is believed to mean “bird woman,” was a member of the Shoshone Indian tribe in what is now Idaho. When she was about 12 years old, she was kidnapped by a rival Indian nation and eventually sold as a slave to Toussaint Charbonneau, a French-Canadian fur trader.</p>
    <p>During her travels with Lewis and Clark, Sacagawea gave birth to a son, Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau. This was fortunate for the expedition. Many Indians at this time had never seen white men. Indians viewed Lewis and Clark as nonthreatening and welcomed them because it was unheard of for a war party to travel with an Indian woman and a baby. </p>
