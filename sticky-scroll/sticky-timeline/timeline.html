                                Scottish inventor James Watt builds a steam engine. In 1764
                                James Watt thought the steam engine of his day lost too much
                                heat, so he invented a condenser to make it more efficient. In
                                1769 he took out a patent and began manufacturing his design.
                                Watt’s steam engines were used in mines, mills, distilleries,
                                and other industries.

                                Scottish inventor James Watt builds a steam engine. In 1764
                                James Watt thought the steam engine of his day lost too much
                                heat, so he invented a condenser to make it more efficient. In
                                1769 he took out a patent and began manufacturing his design.
                                Watt’s steam engines were used in mines, mills, distilleries,
                                and other industries.
